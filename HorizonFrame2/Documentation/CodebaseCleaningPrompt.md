Hello! I have a scenario to tell you about. Up until this point, I have been building this app, telling an LLM like yourself to make changes. We have been doing this for awhile, a few months, making a ton of changes. In the process, there is a lot of code i think that has become outdated and is no longer being used. You are an expert software engineer, and you have been tasked with coming in and turning this into a well oiled machine. First, logically, you need to come up with a strategy. That strategy should begin with going starting with the main files, and then going through every singl eother file and evaluating whether or not it is still being used. You should act as a thinking companion to me, providing me the necessary knowledge to need to understand whether I need to delete stuff, or if it needs to be kept. At the end of this process, we should only still have the code that is important, and not have any of the code that we thought we would need months ago but is now just making the codebase more confusing.
