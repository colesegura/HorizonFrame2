### Technical Architecture

`HorizonFrame` is built using modern iOS development practices with SwiftUI and SwiftData, ensuring a reactive, maintainable codebase. Below are the key technical components and design decisions for a new developer to understand:

1. **Framework and Language:**
   - **SwiftUI:** Used for all UI components, providing declarative, reactive views with animations (e.g., timer progress, tab transitions).
   - **SwiftData:** Handles local persistence for goals (`Goal.swift`) and unlocked awards (`UnlockedAward.swift`), configured in `HorizonFrame2App.swift`.
   - **No External Dependencies:** Pure Apple frameworks, avoiding third-party libraries for simplicity and stability.

2. **Project Structure:**
   - **File Organization:** Located at `/Users/colesegura/Code/HorizonFrame2/HorizonFrame2`, with subfolders for `Views`, `Models`, `Helpers`, etc.
   - **Key Files:**
     - `HorizonFrame2App.swift`: App entry point, sets up SwiftData container.
     - View files under `Views/` (e.g., `TodayView.swift`, `AlignmentFlowView.swift`) for UI.
     - Model files under `Models/` for data structures.
     - Helper files under `Helpers/` for logic like `AwardManager.swift` and `NotificationManager.swift`.

3. **Data Flow and State Management:**
   - **State:** Managed via `@State`, `@Binding`, and `@AppStorage` for UI state (e.g., timer duration, current tab) and persistent settings (e.g., onboarding completion).
   - **Data Persistence:** SwiftData queries (`@Query`) fetch and update goals and awards dynamically in views.
   - **User Progress:** Streak and alignment data tracked locally, updated on completion of daily flow, with logic in `CompletionView.swift`.

4. **Design Patterns:**
   - **Minimalist UI:** Dark theme, pie-chart timer animations (consistent across breathing and visualization), custom tab bar with circular icons.
   - **Modularity:** Views are broken into reusable components (e.g., `StreakCounterView.swift`, `GoalRowView.swift`) for maintainability.
   - **Immersion:** Tab bar hidden during alignment flow for focus, using `.toolbar(.hidden)`.

5. **Key Integrations:**
   - **UserNotifications:** For daily reminders, with permission handling in onboarding and settings.
   - **SF Symbols:** Used extensively for icons (e.g., flame for streak, bell for notifications) to maintain a native iOS aesthetic.

### How It Functions Internally

- **App Launch (`HorizonFrame2App.swift`):** Initializes SwiftData container and presents `MainTabView` or onboarding if first launch (via `@AppStorage` flag).
- **Daily Flow Trigger:** From Today tab, user selects timer duration and starts alignment, navigating through breathing to visualization to completion, with state managed by `currentPage` bindings.
- **Progress Updates:** On alignment completion, streak increments, total alignments update, and `AwardManager` checks for new unlocks, persisting via SwiftData.
- **Notifications:** `NotificationManager` requests permission and schedules reminders based on user settings, triggered daily if enabled.
- **Goal Management:** Users add/reorder/delete goals in Focuses tab, persisted instantly with SwiftData, and visualized sequentially during alignment.

### Current Status and Achievements

- **Feature-Complete:** All core features (onboarding, alignment flow, goal management, progress tracking, awards, settings) are implemented and polished.
- **UI Consistency:** Dark minimalist theme, unified timer animations, immersive flow with hidden tab bar.
- **App Store Readiness:** Prepared for submission with screenshots, promotional text, and build upload guidance provided. TestFlight setup instructions are ready for beta testing.
