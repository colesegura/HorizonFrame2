# HorizonFrame2 Project State

## Overview
HorizonFrame is an iOS mindfulness app designed to help users align their daily goals with their long-term aspirations. The app facilitates a structured daily flow to promote focus and intentionality through mindfulness practices.

## Core Functionalities
- **Onboarding**: A guided setup for new users to personalize their experience.
- **Tab Navigation**: Includes Today, Focuses, Progress, and Settings tabs for easy access to app features.
- **Alignment Flow**: A multi-step process including breathing exercises, goal visualization, and action item planning.
- **Awards System**: Recognizes user achievements and consistency in using the app.
- **Referral System**: Encourages users to invite others, enhancing community growth.

## User Experience Highlights
- **Minimalist Dark Theme**: A clean, distraction-free interface optimized for focus.
- **Immersive Flow**: Engaging animations and transitions during the alignment process.
- **Custom Timer**: Allows users to set personalized durations for mindfulness activities.

## Technical Architecture
- **Framework**: Built with SwiftUI for the user interface and SwiftData for data management.
- **No External Dependencies**: Entirely reliant on native Apple frameworks for a lightweight and secure app.
- **Key Files**:
  - `MainTabView.swift`: Manages the primary tab navigation structure.
  - `AlignmentFlowView.swift`: Defines the multi-step alignment process (Breathing, Visualization, Action Items).

## Internal Functioning
- **State Management**: Utilizes SwiftUIâ€™s state and binding mechanisms for real-time UI updates.
- **Data Persistence**: Leverages SwiftData for storing user goals, progress, and settings locally.
- **Daily Flow Triggers**: Scheduled notifications and reminders to encourage daily app engagement.

## Current Status
- **Feature-Complete**: All planned features for version 2.0 are implemented.
- **Recent Major Updates**:
  - **Onboarding Data Persistence**: Implemented OnboardingDataManager singleton to store goal, visualization, and action item data during onboarding flow
  - **Goal Model Extensions**: Added visualization and isFromOnboarding properties to Goal model
  - **Paywall Redesign**: Complete redesign to match onboarding style with proper free trial messaging and pricing display
  - **Subscription Management**: Fixed infinite recursion bug in SubscriptionManager and improved pricing display
  - **Data Storage**: Switched back to persistent storage to prevent data loss on app restart
- **UI Refinements**: Recent improvements include:
  - Enhanced onboarding flow with clearer placeholders and improved text field behavior
  - Consistent text input formatting across all pages
  - Immediate placeholder disappearance on text field focus
  - Fixed text capitalization to preserve user input
  - Aligned placeholder text with cursor position (leading alignment)
  - Paywall UI matches onboarding design with gradients and dark theme
- **App Store Ready**: The app is prepared for submission and distribution via the Apple App Store.

## Onboarding Guidance for New Developers
- **Setup**: Clone the repository, open in Xcode, and ensure you have the latest version of Swift installed. No additional dependencies are required.
- **Key Files to Review**: Start with `MainTabView.swift` for navigation and `AlignmentFlowView.swift` for the core user flow.
- **Test Tasks**: Run the app in a simulator, complete the onboarding process, and go through a full alignment flow to understand the user experience.
- **Potential Next Features**: Consider integrating CloudKit for data syncing across devices, adding new mindfulness exercises, or enhancing the awards system with social sharing.
- **Collaboration Tips**: Communicate changes via pull requests with detailed descriptions, and update documentation with any new feature or architectural decisions.
